Summary
====================================================



The `mfpml` package is a toolkit for multi-fidelity probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian optimization based on single-/multi-fidelity data resources. This package is design to provide a platform of replicating existing single-/multi-fidelity Bayesian methods based on Gaussian process regression; and also a handy tool for developing new methods in the field of multi-fidelity probabilistic machine learning. Overall, this package has two main features:

1. **Basic methods**: fundamental implementations of popular methods for example Gaussian process regression, Co-Kriging and corresponding extensions \
2. **Advanced Methods**: advanced methods for Bayesian optimization, for instance, riable-fidelity optimization, active learning reliability analysis, multi-fidelity reliability analysis.


Basic Methods
-------------


The `mfpml` package provides essential tools and implementations across four key areas:

1. **Design of Experiments**
   
   - Provides efficient strategies for designing experiments to reduce cost and improve performance.

2. **Functions**
   
   - A collection of commonly used functions for experimental analysis and performance evaluation.

3. **Models**
   
   - **Kriging Model**:  
     A Gaussian process-based surrogate model for single-fidelity data.  
     :attr:`mfpml.models.gaussian_process`
   - **Multi-Fidelity Kriging Model**:  
     Extends Kriging to incorporate multi-fidelity data for better predictions.  
     :attr:`mfpml.models.mf_gaussian_process`

4. **Optimization**
   
   - **Evolutionary Algorithms**:  
     A metaheuristic approach for solving complex optimization problems.  
     :attr:`mfpml.optimization.evolutionary_algorithms`

   - **Single-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization (SFBO)**:  
     Bayesian optimization for expensive single-fidelity black-box functions.  
     :attr:`mfpml.optimization.sfbo`
   - **Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization (MFBO)**:  
     An advanced Bayesian optimization framework that leverages multi-fidelity data.
